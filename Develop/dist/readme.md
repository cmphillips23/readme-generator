  ### Description
  The "ReadMe Generator" is a node application that generates a quality readme with ease.  The ReadMe Generator prompts the user with a series of questions, and then puts those answers in the corresponding sections of the generated readme file.  
  
  ### Installation
  Install node.js.  In your terminal, navigate to the index.js file, and run the command "npm install".  This will install the dependencies for the project.  Now you can type the command "node index.js" to run the application.  
  
  ### Usage 
  Once the application is downloaded and the dependencies are installed, run "node index.js" and answer the questions that are prompted.  The finished readme will be in the 'dist' folder.  
  
  ### Testing 
  There are no hard-coded tests written, so the best way to test it is to try it and double-check the generated markdown file before you use the readme for a project.
